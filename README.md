I’m Chris, a Software Engineer based in Jakarta, Indonesia.

I design and build web or mobile apps.

- My main tech stack includes Laravel, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Framer Motion.
- The databases I use the most are MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- I really love typing — that’s why my code editor of choice is Neovim (yes, I use Neovim btw).

Fun Facts:
- I don’t like matcha.
- Naruto is my favorite anime, but One Piece isn’t bad.
- Hobbies: badminton, music.
